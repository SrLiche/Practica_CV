## Final user
    The target user for this CV are comapnys within the software industrie, more especific video game companys, wich are the companys I will target when I graduate from university. What I think they will expect is a simple but yet clear design with all the specific information about what kind of programing languages I know and all my comunication skills, which are important when working in that enviroment.  
## Architecture
    I've chosen a 2 column display to diferenciate the generic information, in the left column, and the especific information, in the right, so it will contrast each one with a diferent background and style of displaying the information.
## Visual desing
    I've chosen a palet inspired by the Half-Life franchise of games to show that I'm a realy geek guy. The palet conforms this structure:
        - #fb7e14: for a general background color and Title font color.
        - #151515: for the general information box background color
        - #292929: for the Title in the information box background color.
        - ffffff: for the font, wich contrasts perfectly with the background colors chosen above
    For the font choice I've decided to use the Trebuchet MS font, witch is the font used in the Half-Life video game franchise.
    For the text in the footer I've used the Arial font witch is the font used in the logo of Black Mesa, the secret laboratory where the first game of the Half-Life frinchise takes place. 
    In the footer I put and easter egg for the people that know about this video game saga. 
    Please don't mind the profile photo, it's and old one that i have in my pc, I have to update it.
